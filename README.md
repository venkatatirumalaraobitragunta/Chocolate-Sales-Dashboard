# Chocolate-Sales-Dashboard
I built a simple Power BI dashboard to analyze Chocolate Sales across months, countries, products, and salespersons. It shows key metrics like total sales, boxes sold, top products, and regional performance. This project helped me learn data cleaning, DAX basics, and creating clean, interactive visuals.
